# Lab | iOS Swift Drop Shadow Example

The purpose of this application is to experiment on how to add a drop shadow to a ```UIView``` control. The approach can be used to apply drop shadows to controls that inherit from ```UIView``` like ```UILabel``` or ```UIButton```.

The application provides sliders to change the values of:

- The drop shadow X and Y offsets
- The drop shadow radius
- The drop shadow opacity
- The UIView corner radius
